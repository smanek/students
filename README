A small RESTful Java Web Service, described on http://arantaday.com/the-modern-java-ecosystem.

To run it, you can just clone this repo and then run 'mvn tomcat:run' in the directory.

Some example interaction (via CURL):
# List the existing students (there are none)
~$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/student/rest/students
[]

# Create some fake students, and check that they now present
~$ curl -d "name=Shaneal&dob=015-28-1986&courses=CS-301,CS-401,CS-501" http://127.0.0.1:8080/student/rest/students
1
~$ curl -d "name=John&dob=01-02-1984&courses=CS-101,ENG-201,MATH-304" http://127.0.0.1:8080/student/rest/students

~$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/student/rest/students
[1,2]
~$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/student/rest/students/2
{"uid":2,"name":"John","dateOfBirth":441878400000,"enrolled":true,"courses":["CS-101","ENG-201","MATH-304"]}
~$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/student/rest/students/1
{"uid":1,"name":"Shaneal","dateOfBirth":543916800000,"enrolled":true,"courses":["CS-301","CS-401","CS-501"]}

# Delete one of the students, and verify that it is deleted
~$ curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/student/rest/students/1
true
~$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/student/rest/students
